# Frontend Infrastructure (Setup Phase)

This folder contains the foundational structure for the CourseWork Lite frontend.

## Structure

```
frontend/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── App.jsx
└── README.md
```

## Work By: Ehab Kayyali

As the Infrastructure, Deployment, and Testing Support lead, I created this scaffold to:
- Provide a clean and modular React project structure
- Prepare for frontend contributions by UI developers
- Set up the deployment and config pipeline in advance

Further implementation (UI, state management, API integration) will be handled once the frontend team pushes their components.
